Minechem 5
=========

Minechem 5 is a mod about chemistry and chemical industry. Originally maintained by LJDP, Rushmead and Pixlepix. Minechem 5 is maintained by Jakimfett, With help from Mandrake and other open source contributors, and is based off the work of the many previous iterations. Split apart materials into their most basic components, then mesh them all together into something new. The possibilities are immense!

## Disclaimer
This mod contains many street drug jokes, If this offends you. Please do not use this mod.

## Setup
Currently, this only applies to linux operating systems, when you're using the Intellij IDEA. At some point in the future, I'll add more (like an actual setup script or something)

Open a terminal to the folder where you've put the Minechem source code.
Run the following commands, in order:
```
./gradlew cleancache --refresh-dependencies
./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
./gradlew idea
mkdir lib
wget "http://www.chickenbones.craftsaddle.org/Files/goto.php?file=NotEnoughItems-dev&version=1.6.4" -O lib/NotEnoughItems.jar
wget "http://www.chickenbones.craftsaddle.org/Files/goto.php?file=CodeChickenCore-dev&version=1.6.4" -O lib/CodeChickenCore.jar
```
