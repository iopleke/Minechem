Minechem 6
=========

[Minechem](http://www.minechemmod.com/) is a mod about chemistry. Items can be broken down into compounds and base elements using the decomposer. With base elements, a bit of research, and the chemical synthesis machine, you can assemble materials and different compounds. Don't like the base elements you have? Split elements using the Fission reactor, or combine elements using the Fusion reactor.

Download the mod from [CurseForge](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/mc-mods/73373-minechem-5/files) or the releases page here on Github.

By default machines will need power when [CoFHCore](http://www.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/cofhcore) is installed, this can be turned off in the configs.
